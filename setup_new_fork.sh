echo "=== Setting Up New Fork: rayhunter-enhanced-f1 ==="
echo ""

echo "=== Step 1: Create New Repository on GitHub ==="
echo "1. Go to: https://github.com/new"
echo "2. Repository name: rayhunter-enhanced-f1"
echo "3. Description: Enhanced IMSI Catcher Detection with GPS Correlation"
echo "4. Make it Public"
echo "5. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)"
echo "6. Click 'Create repository'"
echo ""

echo "=== Step 2: Update Remote URL ==="
echo "After creating the repository, run these commands:"
echo ""
echo "git remote set-url origin https://github.com/drinkingc0ffee/rayhunter-enhanced-f1.git"
echo "git remote add upstream https://github.com/EFForg/rayhunter.git"
echo ""

echo "=== Step 3: Push to New Repository ==="
echo "Then push your enhanced code:"
echo ""
echo "git push -u origin main"
echo ""

echo "=== Step 4: Create Pull Request ==="
echo "Once pushed, you can create a pull request:"
echo ""
echo "1. Go to: https://github.com/EFForg/rayhunter"
echo "2. Click 'Pull requests'"
echo "3. Click 'New pull request'"
echo "4. Click 'compare across forks'"
echo "5. Set:"
echo "   - base repository: EFForg/rayhunter"
echo "   - base branch: main"
echo "   - head repository: drinkingc0ffee/rayhunter-enhanced-f1"
echo "   - compare branch: main"
echo "6. Create pull request"
echo ""

echo "=== Why This Should Work ==="
echo "✅ Different repository name (no naming conflicts)"
echo "✅ Proper fork relationship"
echo "✅ GitHub can properly compare the changes"
echo "✅ Clean, organized approach"
echo ""

echo "=== Alternative: If PR Still Doesn't Work ==="
echo "If GitHub still can't compare, we can:"
echo "1. Create a branch from upstream/main"
echo "2. Apply your changes incrementally"
echo "3. Create multiple smaller PRs"
echo ""

echo "=== Current Status ==="
echo "You're in: $(pwd)"
echo "Repository: rayhunter-enhanced-f1"
echo "Ready to set up new remote and push!"
