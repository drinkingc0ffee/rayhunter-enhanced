## IMSI Catcher Detection for Mobile Hotspots

Rayhunter is an IMSI Catcher detection and cellular monitoring system designed to help users identify potential surveillance devices by analyzing cellular network behavior. Originally developed for the Orbic mobile hotspot, Rayhunter captures and analyzes cellular network data to detect suspicious activity that may indicate the presence of cell-site simulators (IMSI catchers).

### üéØ What Does Rayhunter Do?

- **Detects rogue cell towers** and fake base stations
- **Monitors cellular network behavior** for suspicious patterns  
- **Captures detailed network data** including signal strength, cell IDs, and network parameters
- **Provides real-time analysis** through a web interface
- **Exports data** for further investigation and research

### üõ°Ô∏è Why Use Rayhunter?

IMSI catchers are surveillance devices that impersonate legitimate cell towers to intercept mobile communications. They're used by law enforcement, intelligence agencies, and malicious actors to:
- Track device locations
- Intercept calls and text messages
- Monitor internet activity
- Collect device identifiers

Rayhunter helps detect these devices by monitoring for anomalous cellular behavior.
