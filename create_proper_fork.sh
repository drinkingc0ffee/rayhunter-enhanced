echo "=== Creating a Proper Fork Solution ==="
echo ""
echo "The issue is that GitHub can't compare repositories with different names."
echo "Your repo: rayhunter-enhanced"
echo "Original: rayhunter"
echo ""
echo "Let's create a proper solution:"
echo ""

echo "=== Step 1: Create a Proper Fork ==="
echo "1. Go to: https://github.com/EFForg/rayhunter"
echo "2. Click the 'Fork' button (top right)"
echo "3. This will create: https://github.com/drinkingc0ffee/rayhunter"
echo "   (Note: this is different from your current rayhunter-enhanced)"
echo ""

echo "=== Step 2: Clone Your New Fork ==="
echo "Run these commands in a new terminal:"
echo ""
echo "cd ~"
echo "git clone https://github.com/drinkingc0ffee/rayhunter.git"
echo "cd rayhunter"
echo ""

echo "=== Step 3: Copy Your Enhanced Files ==="
echo "Then run this script to copy your enhanced files:"
echo ""
echo "cp -r /Users/beisenmann/rayhunter-enhanced/bin ."
echo "cp -r /Users/beisenmann/rayhunter-enhanced/lib ."
echo "cp -r /Users/beisenmann/rayhunter-enhanced/installer ."
echo "cp -r /Users/beisenmann/rayhunter-enhanced/telcom-parser ."
echo "cp -r /Users/beisenmann/rayhunter-enhanced/rootshell ."
echo "cp -r /Users/beisenmann/rayhunter-enhanced/web ."
echo "cp /Users/beisenmann/rayhunter-enhanced/Cargo.toml ."
echo "cp /Users/beisenmann/rayhunter-enhanced/Cargo.lock ."
echo ""

echo "=== Step 4: Create Feature Branch ==="
echo "git checkout -b enhanced-features"
echo "git add -A"
echo "git commit -m 'Add enhanced IMSI catcher detection with GPS correlation'"
echo "git push origin enhanced-features"
echo ""

echo "=== Step 5: Create Pull Request ==="
echo "1. Go to: https://github.com/drinkingc0ffee/rayhunter"
echo "2. Click 'Compare & pull request' for the enhanced-features branch"
echo "3. Set base repository to: EFForg/rayhunter"
echo "4. Set base branch to: main"
echo "5. Create the pull request"
echo ""

echo "=== Alternative: Direct Repository Creation ==="
echo "If the fork approach doesn't work, you can also:"
echo "1. Create a new repository called 'rayhunter' (not rayhunter-enhanced)"
echo "2. Copy your enhanced files there"
echo "3. Create PR from that repository"
echo ""

echo "=== Why This Will Work ==="
echo "✅ Same repository name as original"
echo "✅ Proper fork relationship"
echo "✅ GitHub can properly compare the changes"
echo "✅ Clean, simple approach"
