echo "=== Restructuring Plan: Match Original Structure ==="
echo ""

echo "=== Key Changes Needed ==="
echo ""

echo "🔄 Directory Structure Changes:"
echo "   ❌ Current: bin/ (unified structure)"
echo "   ✅ Target: check/ + daemon/ (original structure)"
echo ""
echo "   ❌ Current: web/ (separate web interface)"
echo "   ✅ Target: daemon/web/ (original web location)"
echo ""

echo "=== Step-by-Step Restructuring Plan ==="
echo ""

echo "1. 📁 Create check/ directory from bin/ functionality"
echo "   - Move bin/src/check.rs → check/src/main.rs"
echo "   - Move check-related code from bin/ to check/"
echo ""

echo "2. 📁 Create daemon/ directory from bin/ functionality"
echo "   - Move bin/src/daemon.rs → daemon/src/main.rs"
echo "   - Move daemon-related code from bin/ to daemon/"
echo "   - Move web/ → daemon/web/"
echo ""

echo "3. 📁 Keep shared directories as-is:"
echo "   - lib/ (enhanced library code)"
echo "   - installer/ (enhanced installation)"
echo "   - telcom-parser/ (enhanced telecom parsing)"
echo "   - rootshell/ (root shell)"
echo "   - tools/ (enhanced utility tools)"
echo ""

echo "4. 📄 Keep core files as-is:"
echo "   - Cargo.toml (with enhanced dependencies)"
echo "   - Cargo.lock"
echo "   - .github/ (CI/CD workflows)"
echo "   - LICENSE, SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md"
echo ""

echo "5. 🗑️ Remove extra files (keep functionality in core):"
echo "   - Documentation files (*.md) - move to doc/"
echo "   - Build scripts (*.sh) - keep essential ones"
echo "   - Docker files - keep docker_make.sh only"
echo ""

echo "=== Benefits of This Approach ==="
echo "✅ Maintains all enhanced functionality"
echo "✅ Matches original directory structure"
echo "✅ Minimal changes to original code paths"
echo "✅ GitHub can properly compare changes"
echo "✅ Easier for maintainers to review"
echo ""

echo "=== Files to Move ==="
echo ""
echo "From bin/ to check/:"
echo "  - bin/src/check.rs → check/src/main.rs"
echo "  - bin/Cargo.toml → check/Cargo.toml"
echo ""
echo "From bin/ to daemon/:"
echo "  - bin/src/daemon.rs → daemon/src/main.rs"
echo "  - bin/src/analysis.rs → daemon/src/analysis.rs"
echo "  - bin/src/config.rs → daemon/src/config.rs"
echo "  - bin/src/diag.rs → daemon/src/diag.rs"
echo "  - bin/src/display/ → daemon/src/display/"
echo "  - bin/src/error.rs → daemon/src/error.rs"
echo "  - bin/src/key_input.rs → daemon/src/key_input.rs"
echo "  - bin/src/pcap.rs → daemon/src/pcap.rs"
echo "  - bin/src/qmdl_store.rs → daemon/src/qmdl_store.rs"
echo "  - bin/src/server.rs → daemon/src/server.rs"
echo "  - bin/src/stats.rs → daemon/src/stats.rs"
echo "  - bin/Cargo.toml → daemon/Cargo.toml"
echo "  - web/ → daemon/web/"
echo ""

echo "=== Enhanced Features to Keep ==="
echo "✅ GPS correlation (in lib/ and daemon/)"
echo "✅ Enhanced cellular analysis (in lib/)"
echo "✅ Modern web interface (in daemon/web/)"
echo "✅ Enhanced installation (in installer/)"
echo "✅ Enhanced tools (in tools/)"
echo "✅ Enhanced telecom parsing (in telcom-parser/)"
