echo "=== Major Structural Differences ==="
echo ""

echo "🔍 Original Rayhunter Structure:"
echo "   - check/ (separate binary)"
echo "   - daemon/ (main daemon with web interface)"
echo "   - lib/ (library code)"
echo "   - installer/ (installation)"
echo "   - telcom-parser/ (telecom parsing)"
echo "   - rootshell/ (root shell)"
echo "   - tools/ (utility tools)"
echo ""

echo "🚀 Enhanced Rayhunter Structure:"
echo "   - bin/ (unified binary - replaces check/ and daemon/)"
echo "   - web/ (separate web interface - moved from daemon/web/)"
echo "   - lib/ (enhanced library code)"
echo "   - installer/ (enhanced installation)"
echo "   - telcom-parser/ (enhanced telecom parsing)"
echo "   - rootshell/ (root shell)"
echo "   - tools/ (enhanced utility tools)"
echo "   - docker-build/ (Docker support)"
echo "   - Multiple documentation files (*.md)"
echo "   - Multiple build scripts (*.sh)"
echo ""

echo "=== Key Differences ==="
echo ""

echo "📁 Directory Structure Changes:"
echo "   ❌ Original: check/ + daemon/"
echo "   ✅ Enhanced: bin/ (unified structure)"
echo ""
echo "   ❌ Original: daemon/web/"
echo "   ✅ Enhanced: web/ (separate web interface)"

echo "📄 File Count Comparison:"
ORIGINAL_COUNT=$(find /tmp/rayhunter -type f | wc -l)
ENHANCED_COUNT=$(find . -type f | wc -l)
echo "   Original: $ORIGINAL_COUNT files"
echo "   Enhanced: $ENHANCED_COUNT files"
echo "   Difference: +$((ENHANCED_COUNT - ORIGINAL_COUNT)) files"
echo ""

echo "📊 Size Comparison:"
ORIGINAL_SIZE=$(du -sh /tmp/rayhunter | cut -f1)
ENHANCED_SIZE=$(du -sh . | cut -f1)
echo "   Original: $ORIGINAL_SIZE"
echo "   Enhanced: $ENHANCED_SIZE"

echo "=== Why GitHub Can't Compare ==="
echo ""
echo "🔍 The codebases are fundamentally different:"
echo "   1. Different directory structure (check/daemon/ vs bin/)"
echo "   2. Different file organization (web interface location)"
echo "   3. Massive increase in file count and size"
echo "   4. No common file paths to compare"
echo "   5. Different repository names (rayhunter vs rayhunter-enhanced)"
echo ""

echo "=== What This Means ==="
echo ""
echo "❌ GitHub's diff algorithm can't find common ground"
echo "❌ No shared file paths to compare"
echo "❌ Too many structural changes"
echo "❌ Different repository naming"
echo ""

echo "=== Recommended Solutions ==="
echo ""
echo "1. 🎯 Create a proper fork with same name"
echo "2. 📁 Restructure to match original layout"
echo "3. 🔄 Create incremental PRs for specific features"
echo "4. 📞 Contact maintainers directly"
