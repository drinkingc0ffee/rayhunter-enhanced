# Installing Rayhunter Enhanced

So, you've got one of the [supported devices](./supported-devices.md), and are ready to start catching IMSI catchers. You have several options for installing Rayhunter Enhanced:

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Options

### Option 1: Docker Environment (Recommended for New Users)
The Docker environment provides a complete, isolated build environment with all dependencies pre-configured:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/rayhunter-enhanced.git
cd rayhunter-enhanced

# Start Docker environment
./docker-build.sh up
./docker-build.sh shell

# Inside container - simple 3-step process
./setup_ubuntu_ci.sh     # Install toolchains & dependencies
./fetch_source.sh        # Download latest source code (if needed)
./build_and_deploy.sh    # Build and deploy to device
```

**Docker Benefits:**
- âœ… **Isolated environment** - No system modifications required
- âœ… **All dependencies included** - Ubuntu 22.04 with full toolchain
- âœ… **Persistent storage** - Work survives container restarts
- âœ… **Cross-compilation ready** - ARM toolchain pre-configured
- âœ… **adb support** - Direct device deployment via USB

### Option 2: Ubuntu Automated Setup
For Ubuntu systems, use the automated setup scripts:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/rayhunter-enhanced.git
cd rayhunter-enhanced

# Set up build environment (one-time setup)
./setup_ubuntu_ci.sh     # Automated setup for CI/CD

# Build everything and deploy
./build_all.sh && ./deploy.sh
```

### Option 3: Local Dependencies (No Root Required)
Install all dependencies locally without affecting your system:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/rayhunter-enhanced.git
cd rayhunter-enhanced

# Install all dependencies locally (no root access needed)
./setup_local_deps.sh

# Build everything and deploy
./build_all.sh && ./deploy.sh
```
